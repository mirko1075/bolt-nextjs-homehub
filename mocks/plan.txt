HomeHub is a coliving management application designed to enhance shared living experiences through gamified task management, shared expense tracking, and a virtual currency system. This app targets households where people share living spaces, such as roommates, students, or coliving communities. Here’s a recap of the key elements and requirements outlined throughout the planning process:

Core Features and Functionalities
User Onboarding: Easy registration, household creation, or joining via invitation code to simplify user entry and setup.

Gamified Task and Expense Management:

Users can create tasks with varying difficulty levels, assign tasks to others, and vote on task completion, which contributes to a member’s reputation.
Shared expenses and custom-split payments allow users to record and track household expenses.
A “Task Marketplace” feature enables users to trade or “sell” tasks to other household members using coins.
Virtual Currency and Reputation:

Coins are earned through task completion and can be used for trading within the household.
Points accumulate in a user’s profile, tracking their overall contributions and satisfaction ratings.
The currency system and gamification ensure that each user has an incentive to participate actively and fairly.
Real-Time Interactivity:

Real-time messaging, notifications, and a live dashboard provide instant updates, making coordination seamless.
Coins, points, and notifications update instantly to keep users engaged and informed of household activities.
API Requirements
To support these features, the app requires a set of robust APIs:

Authentication: For secure user access, supporting email-based and social logins.
Real-Time Messaging: Enables a live chat feature and push notifications to keep household members connected.
Task and Expense Management: Facilitates CRUD operations for tasks and expenses, with custom split options for shared costs.
Gamification: Manages points, ratings, and real-time balance updates, enhancing user engagement and reputation tracking.
Virtual Currency Management: Supports in-app coins for task trading and real-time balance tracking.
Profile and Reputation: Tracks user points and ratings and transfers them across households.
Reporting and Analytics: Provides periodic reports and export options for user contributions and household activity.
Image Storage: For profile pictures and receipts, using secure storage with compression support.
Future Enhancements
HomeHub’s design leaves room for potential enhancements, including:

Redeemable Coins: Future options for coin redemption to unlock features, badges, or exclusive content.
Advanced Reputation Profiles: Additional metrics like task type breakdowns and level-based achievements.
Payment Integration: Enabling real-world transactions and multi-currency support as part of task trading.
Social Media and Coliving Connections: Extending profiles to public view for users searching for coliving opportunities based on reputation scores.
This comprehensive approach will make HomeHub an interactive, user-focused app that simplifies shared living management and encourages accountability, transparency, and collaboration.
